# Welcome to the VS App Center Build Log Wiki

## Introduction
VS App Center Support is exploring better ways to help customers identify and resolve Build Failures. [See the index of identified build failures here](https://tdevere.github.io/AppCenterBuildLog/content.html). Contributions are welcome. Please follow this form when making content submissions:

```
Build Step: (example here might be checkout)
--

## ``` ##[error]Please use the exact error message from build log here. ```
---

* Add meaningful context information 
* and describe the problem


#### Recommendations
---

* Add recommended troubleshooting steps
* These should help isolate the problem

####  Common Problems
---
1. Use this section to identify exact error to solution mapping
* Error/Warning/Messages
* Solutions
* * Included in [BuildLogAnalyzer.ps1](https://github.com/tdevere/AppCenterBuildLog/blob/master/PowerShellScripts/BuildLogAnalyzer.ps1): NO/YES

```

For an example, take a look at the document: [yarn-npm-install-error.md](https://github.com/tdevere/AppCenterBuildLog/blob/master/yarn-npm-install-error.md.md)

Note that we're including a PowerShell script [BuildLogAnalyzer.ps1](https://github.com/tdevere/AppCenterBuildLog/blob/master/PowerShellScripts/BuildLogAnalyzer.ps1) which can be used to analyze build logs for known problems identified by this Wiki. If we can identify a problem and solution from build logs alone, we'll work to develop a script for it. Eventually, it may be feasible to start with a build log review from this script to identify known issues without manually searching the logs.
